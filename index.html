            My name is Cristopher Saravia. I am 30 years old and I was born in Los Angeles, California. Some of my hobbies are playing guitar and video games. For music, I like to study up on music theory. Most people don't like music theory even though they like music, but it's quite interesting to me. it's like finding out the rules to a game and then trying to break the rule to show your own individuality in your music. I like serveral types of genres, but if I had to pick one, it would have to be rock. One of my favorite albums is "Fortress" by Protest the Hero. It's a very technical metal album. From a guitarist perspective, it contains a lot of different styles that stems from multiple rock genres and also the classical genre. located right below this paragraph is audio for one of my favorite songs called Wretched.

            My second hobby would have to be video games. One of my all time favorite games is Super Smash Bros. Melee. Melee is a old game that was released on the Nintendo Gamecube in the year 2001. I use to play it competitively in the Melee scene in DFW from 2012-2017. Melee is a very fast technical game that requires a lot of inputs in order to play it. At the bottom is a video that show cases the amount of inputs one must do in order to play the game.
